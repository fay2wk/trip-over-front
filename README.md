#trip-over-front
An app created to consume data from a server database (API: trip-over: https://github.com/fay2wk/trip-over) containing information of different cities and the various attractions in each city. Users can create an account to plan and save trips by selecting a city, and then selecting multiple attractions for each trip. They can also edit and delete these saved trips the next time they login.
